As the outstanding technical achievement attained when an inter-
national team lead by AMSAT-DL completed the Earth-Venus-Earth path 
on March 25 continues to reverberate throughout the Amateur Radio 
world a recap of the event and links to additional details is in 
order.

The team consisted of many well known amateurs including Wolfgang 
Büscher, DL4YHF; Freddy de Guchteneire, ON6UG; Hermann Hagner, DK8CI; 
Michael Lengrüsser, DD5ER; Karl Meinzer, DJ4ZC; James Miller, G3RUH;
Max Münich, DJ1CR; Hartmut Paesler, DL1YDD; and Achim Vollhardt,
DH2VA.

AMSAT-DL President Peter Guelzow, DB2OS provided a report of the
accomplishment from the 20 meter dish located at the IUZ Sternwarte 
Observatory in Bochum, Germany. The transmitter used a rubidium
locked reference to generate about 6 kW CW on 2.4 GHz. The use of a 
magnetron for this purpose was possible thanks to a new AMSAT-DL 
developed modulator that enables a magnetron to be used for narrow 
band operation.

After traveling almost 100 million kilometers with a round trip delay 
of about 5 minutes, the transmitted signal was clearly received as 
echoes from the surface of Venus. FFT analysis software with an inte-
gration time of 5 minutes was used. After integrating for only 2 min-
utes the reflected signals were clearly visible in the display. 
Despite the bad weather, signals from Venus could be detected from 
1038 UTC on until the planet reached the local horizon.

Receiving planetary echoes is a first in Germany and Europe. This 
also marks the farthest distance attained by radio amateurs. The dis-
tance via the Earth-Venus-Earth path is  over 100 times further 
than the echoes from the moon via EME reflexions.

Bob McGwier, N4HY observed the equipment and software used can be iden-
tified, "In the photographs attached to this press release, one can see 
the SDR-IQ (http://rfspace.com/Home.html) and Spectrum Lab

Jess, W4MVB expressed the admiration of Amateur Radio operators around
the world in his message, "Congratulations to you and your team for this 
outstanding accomplishment! I simply can't believe how far we have come 
since I first heard OSCAR 1 & 2 transmitting "HI" from space. I feel 
privileged to be a witness to the kind of success our hobby has experi-
enced  thanks to you and all  the dedicated amateurs around the world 
who have brought us to this point."
