# EVE
the world first successfull Earth-Venus-Earth amateur radio communication by AMSAT-DL from the 20m Radio telescope at the Bochum Observatory (Sternwarte Bochum).

We hope this material is useful for anyone who wants to repeat this. But "de minimis" they should try to replicate what we did and send "HI HI" to Venus and back.
